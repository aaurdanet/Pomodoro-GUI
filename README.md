Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro timer implemented using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Features

  Focus Timer: Set for 25 minutes to focus on work.
  Short Break Timer: After each focus interval, take a 5-minute short break.
  Long Break Timer: After completing 4 focus intervals, take a 20-minute long break.
  Visual Feedback: Check marks appear to indicate completed focus intervals.

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org. No additional installations are required as the code utilizes Python's built-in libraries.
How to Use

  Run the script by executing python main.py in your terminal or command prompt.
  Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
  Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.
  Work during the focus intervals and take breaks during the break intervals.

Customization

  You can adjust the duration of the focus, short break, and long break intervals by modifying the constants WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, and LONG_BREAK_MIN respectively.
  You can change the appearance of the timer window by modifying the color constants defined in the code (PINK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW).
